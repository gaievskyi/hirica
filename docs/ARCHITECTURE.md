# Atomic Design

[Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner.

## Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

## Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

## Organisms

Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

## Templates

Templates are groups of organisms stitched together to form a page.

## Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.
